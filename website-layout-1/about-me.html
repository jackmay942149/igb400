    <div class="flex justify-between items-center">
      <p class="p-4 max-w-4/5"><b>August 2025</b> - I am a final year student at QUT completing a Bachelor's degree in Games and Interactive Environments. I started the degree in 2021, as I had little career direction and was developing an interest in programming. I originally started with computer science, however I pivoted in semester one of first year to take more specialised classes and have more freedom to explore in this regard. My first two years I focused on trying out different specialisations to find a niche that I might be interested in further pursuing. In my third year I was introduced to graphics programming and have been attached to the specialisation since. My third and fourth years have been a very transformative part of my life and I am extremely excited to have a career in software development. In my sparetime I am developing a game/engine with a group of friends, and I train for triathlon.</p>
