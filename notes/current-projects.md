# Current projects for possible consideration for portfolio
I am including categories/tags associated with the project and the reason I like them, intended to be evaluated just based on their ideas. These projects are not everything I have made, they are simply ones I think are worth adding, are personally interesting, and I would be able to confidently talk about them during an interview.

## Big projects
### Masterchef VR
Tags: `VR` `Unity` `Industry Partner` `University` `C#`
Team Size: `4 + 5`
This was a university project in collaboration with Banijay Entertainment and Breda University, in the Netherlands (the + 5). We made a VR experience to emulate what it would be like to be a contestant in Masterchef if it was a super crazy edition (for example the 'pilot', the level we delivered, which was in space). This is one of my favourite projects, I have a self interest in Masterchef and cooking and it was a really cool experience to work with Banijay. When I talk to people outside of the gamedev space, about my studies this is usually the first thing I talk about. This was my second VR project and first non prototype VR project. I took this class reasonably early in the degree and felt I really dived into the deep end with this. This project absolutely made me more passionate about VR development.

### Capstone
Tags: `PC` `Unreal` `Industry Partner` `University` `C++` `C#` `Go`
Team Size: `8`
It's capstone it would be weird not to have on my portfolio, anyone reading this already knows my capstone (its the gladiator one). There is alot of skills I can highlight here with shaders, AI, C++, Unreal, CICD, and other tools. Including the potential here for web based tool development, mobile development, client server architecture etc. (Being deliberately vague here).

### 400
Tags: `Unknown`
Team Size: `1`
Reasonable assumption this project will make it to my portfolio. Looking to hit low level graphics programming here think vulkan, openGL, directX, glsl, hlsl, shadergraphs, maybe openXR etc.

### Oh My Gourd VR
Tags: `VR` `Vulkan` `OpenXR` `Game Jam` `Odin` `GLSL`
Team Size: `3`
This is a VR project we made in 3ish weeks (2 weeks for engine and rendering, 1 week for game - when we got the prompt). The project uses Vulkan graphics API and OpenXR platform API from Khronos. This is one of my most impressive pieces and anyone with vulkan or openXR experience would attest to this. Its also written in Odin which is quickly becoming my favourite programming language.

### Eco Explorations
Tags: `VR` `Unity` `Freelance` `C#`
Team Size: `6 + x`
This is a VR project I completed with the University for a program for educating school-aged children about the environment using immersive technology. I worked as a main programmer on 1 of the modules, this is a larger project which has 3 modules at time of writing (hence + x). I like including this project as it shows professional work, there is a neat shader as well and it adds more VR in my portfolio (I am wanting as much graphics, tools and VR programming as I can get)

### Rock Bottom
Tags: `Android` `Unreal` `University` `Industry Partner` `Freelance`
Team Size: `4`
This is a university project with an industry partner to develop a mobile educational game. It is setup for android and is a puzzle game using the accelerometer to tilt water balls through a minesite. This project also has been extended as freelance work outside of university to make available for access via play store and additional learning elements. I like this project because it broadens my portfolio with mobile development (I don't want to do anymore unpaid mobile dev). It also shows solo programming in a team, working with Unreal, and additional freelance work.

## University projects (that aren't big projects)
Including these kinds of projects to as smaller but useful university projects, it may be worthwhile highlighting here the smaller timeframe as each one is kind of a special skill

### IGB383 (AI) Othercide turnbased AI recreation
Tags: `PC` `Unity` `University` `C#`
Team Size: `1`
Small few week project around implementing pathfinding in unity. I think this is a neat project to include as it shows DSA in a practical sense and it also shows a good example of timing with callbacks as the 'minigame' is turn based. If you have played Othercide it uses that initiative system. The initiative system was an unrequired extension to the university project.

### Fishing Sim VR
Tags: `VR` `Unity` `University` `C#`
Team Size: `1`
This is a 2-3 week virtual reality unity game prototype for a god like fishing game. I like this project as it shows ability to rapid prototype in VR, it is also my first attempt at VR, and is influential and sentimental to myself.

### IGB100 Online Leaderboard Speedrun
Tags: `PC` `Unity` `University` `C#`
Team Size: `4`
This is my first collaborative game made in a game jam like format for IGB100. The part I would like to highlight here was the online leaderboard we implemented which really helped us to facilitate widespread playtesting and overall interest in the project from our peers.

### Unreal water shader
Tags: `Video` `Unreal` `University`
Team Size: `2`
This is a part of a larger project from KNB135 which is about environmental art, it is the gold idol one if you know it. What I want to highlight here was the shader I made to have water that was mossy and could be cleared at runtime using vertex painting. This is cool because it facilitates many ideas, showcases an added understanding of shaders and was one of my earlier shader works that got me interested in graphics programming.

## Game Jams (that aren't big projects)
Game jams I have done that are interesting and complete

### Be Quiet!
Tags: `PC` `Unreal` `Game Jam`
Team Size: `2`
This was a game jam where I wanted to move past the point of tutorials in unreal and gain some confidence in using the engine. I ended up doing a deep dive into procedural generation using the PCG graph. The maps for the game are all procedurally generated and it was a complete (or at least as complete as a 1 week game jam allows) experience.

### Carnival Ducks
Tags: `PC` `Unity` `C#` `Game Jam`
Team Size: `2`
This was a neat game jam and it is one of my more complete game jams (It even had menus). I don't know if I learnt a huge amount from this one but it was an impromptu 1 week game jam that I did with a friend just for interest which is cool.

### Bubble Gun Platformer
Tags: `PC` `Unity` `C#` `Game Jam`
Team Size: `7`
This was a game jam for Global Game Jam that was with my capstone team to practice working together prior to the course starting. The cool part I'd want to highlight here is the bubble formation shader which utilised render textures to allow the player at runtime to construct unique structures made of bubbles.

## Side Projects
This section is here to highlight some self interest and is largely surrounding early graphics programming resources which people recommend starting with including Raytracing in One Weekend and Learn OpenGL

### C++ Software Raytracer
Tags: `PC` `C++` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
This was my interpretation of the Raytracing in One Weekend series. It is a favourable beginner project amongst graphics programmers and showcases a lot of mathematics ability and understanding of graphics. This was additionally the first project I did a deep dive into floors of OOP and Inheritance on performance.

### BMP File Converter
Tags: `CLI` `C++` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
This is tied to the previous project and was a cli tool I created due to an annoyance I had with it. Raytracing in a weekend reasonably gets you to output the renders to .PPM format which is a really simple format but it is an unshareable format as it runs only through GIMP. I wrote this program to convert the .PPM to .BMP so I could share renders online easily. This project has value as being very documentation driven and I did not use libraries so I dealt a lot with binary encoding. I like this project because it altered my mindset towards file formats and I am much more comfortable with working them at a low level.

### Golang OBJ Viewer
Tags: `PC` `OpenGL` `Go` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
This is my take on the learnopengl series. I wanted to try out a new programming language, one that does not utilise OOP like c++ and c#, so I did the series in Go. It is a small application which just allows the user to load a obj file and display it to the screen. I like this project as it shows ability to write procedural code, work with new tools, and is a good beginner project for a graphics programmer.

### Wreckless
Tags: `PC` `Odin` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
This is my engine im not ready to show it but I would put it here if I was, when I have a GUI I would consider this.

## Tools/CLIs
### Unreal helix support
Tags: `CLI` `Go` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
This is a CLI tool I wrote to automate the process of setting up my IDE to work with Unreal Engine. I have been using Helix the modal text editor for about a year now and its biggest downside is its lack of Unreal Integration. The plugin I made generates the required .clangd file for most editors (everything except VS, VSCode, Jetbrains) to have LSP navigation and autocomplete. I like this project because it shows optimisation of workflow, working with different tools,creating CLI's and working with different parts of Unreal (UBT).

### CI/CD Plugin Checker w/ Github Actions
Tags: `CLI` `Go` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
This was a simple weekend project which is a golang cli tool to check plugin changes and project destructive commits. The cli was set up to be run through Github Actions and would give pull requests contextual messages to alert approvers of possible concerns. This project is good to have because many job applications require some CICD experience and this ticks that box to a reasonable degree (Maybe not if you were going for a CICD job but as a bonus it definitely works)

### To big for git
Tags: `CLI` `Odin` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
This was a small one day project which was created out of necessity for a project that was late into development before any version control was set up. The tool recursively goes through and adds smaller commits which can still be pushed with HTTP to github, and with optional flags can output a list of files that wou;d be suggested to use git LFS for. I like this project because it was my first time using odin and is another cool dev tool to have listed. It also shows a good understanding of git cli, github, and git lfs.

## Bonus
This section I am a little unsure of. It is 4 3D asset creation projects. While I would not apply for 3D art related roles I think understanding 3d asset creation tools at a user level is an insanely valuable asset to a graphics programmer and it goes a long way in understanding project requirements and helps significantly in graphics debugging and optimisation.

### Goorg
Tags: `3D Art` `University`
Team Size: `1`
3D character in ps2 style graphics, designed to look like a character from Munch's Odyssey.

### Iron giant
Tags: `3D Art` `University`
Team Size: `1`
A Series of mockup posters using a 3d render of my interpretation of the Iron Giant. It is a cool project because it showcases unreal as a rendering engine and is horror themed which is a personal interest.

### Mailbox
Tags: `3D Art` `University`
Team Size: `1`
My first 3D asset creation. It's cool because I have nostalgia for it and it has some clean renders.

### Silent Hill
Tags: `3D Art` `Side Project`
Team Size: `1`
A side project I did one day, which was recreating the road sign 'Welcome to silent hill', a cool project because I wanted to explore 3D materials and practice 3D asset creation outside of university.
